# Gas Detector Project

The Gas Detector Project is a comprehensive software solution designed to monitor toxic gas levels in real-time, leveraging the power of React, TypeScript, Chart.js, and Tailwind CSS. This project aims to enhance safety measures by providing an effective tool for detecting and responding to elevated gas concentrations promptly.

**Note:** The Gas Detector Project currently requires additional hardware or a backend system to collect and display gas concentration data. For more information and available solutions, please visit the [Gas-Detector organization repositories](https://github.com/orgs/exceed19-02/repositories).

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** The Gas Detector Project allows users to monitor toxic gas levels in real-time, providing up-to-the-minute data on the concentration of gases.

- **Automatic Alarms:** Safety is a top priority, and the project includes automatic alarm systems that trigger when gas levels exceed predefined safety thresholds. This feature ensures immediate attention and response to potentially hazardous situations.

- **Window-opening Mechanisms:** In addition to alarms, the Gas Detector Project incorporates window-opening mechanisms triggered automatically in response to high gas concentrations. This proactive approach helps in ventilating the area and mitigating potential risks.
